# Numerical_Methods_Codes
Homework codes I wrote for the Numerical Methods Lecture
rational_to_binary: Converts the given rational number to its binary correspondant
bisection_method: Implements the bisection method so that its inputs are a, ϵ and output is x such that |a^(1/5) − x| ≤ ϵ
Newton_and_Secant: Implements the Newton and Secant methods for solving the equation f(x) = 4ln(x)−x, where f′(x) = 4/x−1
Polynomial_Plot: Plot of certain functions I came up with as the solution, using python library functions
Divided_difference: Finds the divided difference values for given x and f(x) values
Lagrange_Intrerpolation: Implements the Lagrange Interpolation of a quadratic function
